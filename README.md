# WEB 4900r
Independent Research - web security.

## TOPIC 1 - CORS
Just planning on going in-depth on the official w3 documentation. Not sure how long this will take, but I’m going to estimate about 11 hours. I’ve had a lot of CORS issues with past web dev projects, so I really want to learn this inside & out. I want to dedicate the whole first week to it, at least.

## TOPIC 2 - API Best Practices
Rate limiting, canary checks, validation. Will probably spend 11 hours on this as well, since API writing was a huge topic in my other classes.

## TOPIC 3 - TLS vs SSL vs HTTPS
Estimating 6 hours. Just the basics of it, nothing too crazy.  Best practices, how to get set up, etc. About one hour per topic, then an hour for how they all play together.

## TOPIC 4 - Web Traffic Safety
CSP, X-Frame-Option, X-XSS-Protection kind of stuff. Probably just 5 hours since a lot of related information will be covered in other topics.

## TOPIC 5 - Key Negotiation
5 hours. Different strategies for encryption & decryption; PGP, Diffie-Hellman.  Wondering if I should add sessions and httpOnly cookies into this mix as well, or if that should be it’s own topic.
* [PGP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy)
* [Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange in Plain English](https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/45963/diffie-hellman-key-exchange-in-plain-english)

## TOPIC 6 - Attacks and Vulnerabilities
Another week on this, so 11 hours. Just researching different known issues and how they came to be found out. How to prevent against them.

## TOPIC 7 - Cloud Configuration
Ports, VPCs, APTs, immutable infrastructures. This will be kind of new to me, so I want to give myself the full week, 11 hours.

## TOPIC 8 - Review & Security Checklist
I’ll give myself a little breathing room for this one, with about 15 hours total here. It will probably be less, since I’ll probably go over some hours on a few of these topics. I have to also create a presentation of what I’ve learned, so some of the time here will be spent for that as well. I want to ultimately create a “checklist” of important security practices to put into place during web development.
