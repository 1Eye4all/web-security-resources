<p>Hello, this blog post is going to be kind of different, in that it is more of an amalgamation of resources I keep up with as kind of a checklist for web security.  I've always been pretty interested in computer security in general, and my emphasis throughout college was in web development, so web security is my happy ground between the two topics.  These resources and tips are things I keep in mind while making web apps and working on projects, or even maintaining my <a href="https://telepathics.xyz" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">website</a> in general.</p>

<h2>Guides</h2>
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://owasp.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OWASP</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://trailofbits.github.io/ctf/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CTF Field Guide</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/qazbnm456/awesome-web-security" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Awesome Web Security</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://bitvijays.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Magic of Learning</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I've mentioned the owasp site before, in my <a href="https://blog.telepathics.xyz/web/websec/ssl-tls-https">ssl/tls https</a> blog post.  They have really great resources in general, and I support the project whole-heartedly.  CTF is something I am interested in getting into in the future, as I've heard it mentioned a couple of times by my favourite security YouTuber, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClcE-kVhqyiHCcjYwcpfj9w" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LiveOverflow</a>.</p>

<h2>News and Blogs</h2>

</ul>
<p>Usually, I'll check these pages randomly throughout the week for some new information, tips, tricks, and whatever.  I'm actually not a huge blog reader, but every so often, an article will catch my eye.  I also follow a bunch of general development blogs that I might include in a similar resources-style blog post.</p>

<h2>Twitter Accounts</h2>

</ul>
<p>I actually get a lot of my security quickfixes from twitter.  I've made a (private) account just to follow info/websec people, and my current list is about 92 people long.  These are just my top favourites at the moment.  However, if you find the account, please don't request to follow it, since I also use that as a mind dump for very personal matters.</p>

<h2>Security Checklists</h2>
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/WebAppSec/Secure_Coding_Guidelines" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mozilla WebAppSec</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Web_Application_Security_Guide/Checklist" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WikiBooks WebAppSec</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://www.powerdown.io/blog/posts/stories/web-developer-security-checklist.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PowerDown WebDevSec Checklist</a></li>
</ul>
<p>My end goal for the Independent Research course this summer was to develop my own security checklist.  I'm not sure what I could write that is better than these lists, so I'm including them here.</p>
