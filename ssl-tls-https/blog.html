<p>SSL and TLS are encryption protocols.  For this blog post, I will be talking mostly about its integration with the web Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).  You enable an extra layer of security by running HTTP over SSL/TLS, commonly known as HTTPS.  Since HTTP is an application layer protocol in the OSI layer model, SSL/TLS acts as a verification middle-man between the application and the server.</p>

<h2>SSL/TLS</h2>
<p>In 1993, Netscape introduced SSL, an encryption protocol that would sit between the TCP and Application layer.  Its purpose was to ensure security between the client and the server.  However, Netscape never released the first version due to severe bugs and flaws.  The first official release was the second version, released in 1995.  Over time, even more bugs crawled out of the woodwork, and Netscape put it to rest in 2015.  It is now deprecated, and IEFT released a <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7568" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2015 statement</a> announcing that everyone should use TLS instead.</p>

<p>There are currently five SSL/TLS protocols available.  In short, the best practice is to support TLS v1.0 or higher.  As of <a href="https://www.ssllabs.com/ssl-pulse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 3, 2018</a>, you can see we are working toward that goal!</p>

<h3>How SSL/TLS Works</h3>
<p>SSL intended to solve the web's authentication and authorization problems.  Netscape believed that RSA encryption could take care of this, so the SSL handshake was born.  For each client and server connection, the SSL handshake generates a new key.</p>
<img class="aligncenter" src="https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSFKSJ_7.1.0/com.ibm.mq.doc/sy10660a.gif" alt="SSL Handshake.  Source: IBM" />
<p>Message digests detect and prevent data tampering.  TLS does essentially the same process, with more secure underlying cryptographic algorithms.</p>

<h3>SSL Security Issues</h3>
<p>As usual, misconfigured SSL preconditions may lead to man-in-the-middle attacks.  Usually, this means the attacker has stolen the server key, or they have stolen/spoofed the Certificate Authority.  The SSL key exchange relies on weak algorithms, such as SHA-1 and MD5, which makes these attacks much more vulnerable.  SSL limits security, especially compared to what TLS can offer.</p>

<p>The most famous weakness of SSL was an exploit dubbed <a href="https://www.openssl.org/~bodo/ssl-poodle.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">'POODLE'</a>, which took advantage of downgrading from TLS back to SSL.  This attack triggered the end of SSL maintenance, which is super hilarious to me.  Death by poodle.</p>

<p>You can test for POODLE by using <a href="https://github.com/drwetter/testssl.sh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">testssl.sh</a>, which I will also talk more about <a href="#ssl-tls-testing">later</a>.  Luckily, only about 0.7% of the 138,874 websites surveyed by <a href="https://ssllabs.com/ssl-pulse">SSL Labs</a> are still vulnerable to the POODLE attack, so we don't necessarily have to worry too much.</p>

<h3>TLS Takeover</h3>
<p>The Transport Layer Security protocol is the more secure successor of SSL.  Consensus Development released the first version in 1999 as an upgrade to SSL v3.0.  It has had a few updates since, with the most recent version proposed as of March 21, 2018.  The Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council even suggests that everyone upgrades or migrates to TLS <a href="https://blog.pcisecuritystandards.org/are-you-ready-for-30-june-2018-sayin-goodbye-to-ssl-early-tls" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">before <b>June 30, 2018</b></a>, which is just around the corner.</p>

<p>I already mentioned that SSL relied on weak algorithms.  TLS v1.3 has removed support for MD5 and SHA-224 hash functions, and continues to push for even stronger options.  We saw SSL's attempt to protect data with message digests, and now TLS also uses more secure key HMAC to avoid data tampering.  Two hash algorithms increase security when generating key data with the "Enhanced Pseudorandom Function".</p>

<h2>Current Issues</h2>
<p>Disabling weak SSL and enabling strong TLS ciphers can fix a couple of known cryptographic exploits.  There are also some other issues in RSA and other key negotiations.  Luckily, most modern browsers no longer consider some exploits, such as BEAST (Browser Exploit Against SSL/TLS), as valid threats.</p>

<h3>SWEET32 / Birthday Attacks</h3>
<p>I love Javascript.  It's so versatile.  You can use its powers for both good and evil.  Essentially, with the <a href="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SWEET32</a> vulnerability, an attacker can inject Javascript to override the "secure" flag on cookies.  According to <a href="https://blogs.sap.com/2017/05/07/top-10-ssl-security-vulnerability-and-solution-part-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sap</a>:</p>
<blockquote>"With the SWEET32 vulnerability, it is now shown that an attacker can send in large volume of dummy data, and get blocks of cipher text that matches that of a customer.  It is possible because the 64-bit blocks used by 3DES-DES generates a lot of packets, which increases the probability of an encrypted packet of a customer and that of the attacker matching."</blockquote>
<p>This is definitely a man-in-the-middle attack, since the attacker intercepts the HTTPS connnection, especially during  <a href="https://blog.telepathics.xyz/web/websec/cors">cross-site</a> scripting.</p>

<h3>Protocol Downgrade Attacks</h3>
<p>Similar in logic to how the POODLE exploit worked, servers that support a TLS fallback signalling suite can detect protocol downgrade attacks by clients.  It is important to enable support for this kind of defense.  Another example of a downgrade attack is intercepting web traffic and redirecting users to an unencrypted HTTP version of the website.  They are usually part of a larger man-in-the-middle attack, and removing backward compatibility can usually fix them.</p>

<h3>Certificate Authority Exploits</h3>
<p>A Certificate Authority (CA) is who you would buy your SSL/TLS certificate from.  They have a private key to sign the issued Root Certificate, which is a public key, trusted by browsers to verify valid HTTPS websites.  Some popular CA authorities include Comodo, Digicert, and Symantec.  You can get different types of SSL/TLS certificates depending on what you need in validation or domain setup.  The "rule of thumb" is to check your browser for a secure status, usually indicated by a green lock and the https:// protocol.</p>

<p>In 2011, which some security experts deem to be the worst year for CAs, there were a handful of digital certificate attacks.  Namely, there were was a compromise with Comodo, which breached nine certificates across seven domains.  These domains included login.yahoo.com, mail.google.com, login.skype.com, and addons.mozilla.org, which are all typically trustworthy websites.  Fortunately, CAs detected this attack pretty quickly, and immediately revoked the certificates.</p>

<p>Other CA attacks may include (more) man-in-the-middle attacks that play with digital certificates and SSL/TLS traffic.  You can prevent most of these by using stricter browser controls.  There have also been problems with illegitimate certificates installed by malware, or mistakes made when a CA sells to an illegitimate company.  <a href="https://resources.infosecinstitute.com/cybercrime-exploits-digital-certificates" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Infosec Institute</a> has a really nice breakdown of other ways Certificate Authorities have been exploited, and even how you can steal your own digital certificate.  Luckily, CAs are taking more measures to prevent similar exploits.</p>

<h3>Active Network Attacks</h3>
<p>Moxie Marlinspike introduced an SSL "stripping" attack in 2009, and has even offered a tool to exploit it called <a href="https://github.com/moxie0/sslstrip" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sslstrip</a>.  The project looks like moxie has not touched it for the last seven years.  On the official software page, moxie describes the exploit as such:</p>

<blockquote>"It will transparently hijack HTTP traffic on a network, watch for HTTPS links and redirects, then map those links into either look-alike HTTP links or homograph-similar HTTPS links. It also supports modes for supplying a favicon which looks like a lock icon, selective logging, and session denial."</blockquote>

<p>There are a couple of other active network attacks, such as upside-down-ternet and dsniff.  Upside-down-ternet is more of a prank you can play on your friends, but it does showcase the vulnerabilities available in this space.</p>

<h2>Implementing HTTPS</h2>
<p>Any HTTP request encrypted over SSL/TLS as an extra step to protect traffic is HTTPS.  We're looking at a huge push for HTTPS right now, with even browsers such as Chrome advocating for HTTPS, or else they'll warn visitors or even block people from entering your site.  According to <a href="https://statoperator.com/research/https-usage-statistics-on-top-websites/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">statoperator</a>, about 355,216 out of the top 1,000,000 websites sites use HTTPS as a default, with the number climbing even more every day (as of June 7, 2018).</p>

<h3>Free Options</h3>
<p>With the movement to push all web pages to serve HTTPS, some projects offer free or shared certificates.  The most popular one is <a href="https://letsencrypt.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Let's Encrypt</a>, but the service I have the most experience with is <a href="https://cloudflare.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cloudflare</a>.  However, more companies are offering more options.  I hope soon, the web can deprecate HTTP altogether.  Might be a bit of a dream, but I think it could be possible.</p>

<h3>Issues with HTTPS</h3>
<p>HTTPS should serve absolutely all pages.  Failure to server sources such as CSS, scripts, images, and AJAX requests allows room for man-in-the-middle attacks.  This means we have to be super careful about the Mixed Content issue. It only takes one HTTP request to reach HTTPS pages.  Also remember to preload the HTTP Strict Transport Security header into browsers.  Make sure you mark all of your cookies as "secure".  Misconfiguration is always going to be an issue.</p>

<p>To temporarily solve mixed-content, put this meta tag into each of your head tags:</p>
<code>&lt;meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" content="upgrade-insecure-requests"></code>
<p>This will treat all of your insecure HTTP URLs as though they are HTTPS.  This is only a temporary solution in most cases.  If you try to access a resource over HTTPS that does not actually support SSL/TLS, you will not get a response.  If you use the <strong>upgrade-insecure-requests</strong> content security policy (CSP), be sure you <i>do not</i> implement <strong>block-all-mixed-content</strong>.</p>

<h3>HSTS</h3>
<p>The HTTP Strict Transport Security policy protects against downgrade attacks and cookie hijacking, as we've previously discussed.  Strict declarations accept certain connections, and it does not run over insecure HTTP.  Essentially, the server asks the browser via an HTTPS response if there is a <strong>Strict-Transport-Security</strong> policy in place, and if the header is valid, it will allow the browser secure access for a limited amount of time.</p>

<img class="aligncenter" src="https://blog.telepathics.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/hsts-and-caa.png" alt="HSTS and CAA" />

<p>This solves the issue of many man-in-the-middle attacks, since it ensures that the connection is and should be secure.  It also protects against <a href="https://blog.telepathics.xyz/information-technology/infosec/krack">KRACK</a>!  You should definitely pre-load your HSTS, since the an attacker can strip the HSTS header if it is their first visit.  To enable preloading, you can add a <strong>preload</strong> token to your server's response header, and <a href="https://hstspreload.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">submit your domain</a> to a maintained list of preloaded sites.</p>

<h2 id="ssl-tls-testing">SSL/TLS/HTTPS Maintenance</h2>
<p>I found this <a href="https://www.aptive.co.uk/blog/tls-ssl-security-testing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cool guide</a> on SSL/TLS security testing with <code>testssl.sh</code>.  It covers several bases, including SWEET32/FREAK/POODLE/etc testing, telling you what ciphers your server supports, and giving you warnings.  A full list of features can be found on the <a href="https://github.com/drwetter/testssl.sh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">testssl git repo</a>.  If you're into front-end interfaces, TKCERT also created <a href="https://github.com/TKCERT/testssl.sh-webfrontend" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an app for that</a>!</p>

<p>I already talked about content-security-policy, but to really take advantage of it, please enable <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CSP Reports</a>.  You need to manually specify the policy directive and a URI for delivery, since the CSP (strangely) does not send reports by default.</p>

<p>You can also go through OWASP's thorough <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing_for_SSL-TLS_(OWASP-CM-001)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SSL/TLS testing guide</a>.</p>
